Three Datasets have been provided in this repository.

Marketing Team Data:
The original dataset given to us.

Dataset1:
This dataset has been grouped by campaign IDs and names directly. The original dataset was divided by age groups, whereas dataset1 holds summed up figures such as impressions, clicks etc. The % figures have also been dealt with through proper mathematics.

Dataset2:
This dataset has also been grouped by campaign IDs and names. However, what's different is that for the campaigns that were directed to educators, the young age groups such as 18-26 have already been filtered out, and in case of student-directed campaigns, only age groups 13-17 and 18-26 have been included. This initiative was taken as the excelerate document informed us that certain campaigns are directed to certain age groups.

Example Graphs to be plotted:
1- Bar plots
We can plot bar plots using campaign IDs on X axis and using CPC/CTR/Unique CTR etc on Y axis. This would give us the efficiency of campaigns

2-Bubble/Scatter plots
We can plot bubble plots using campaign IDs on X axis and using CPC/CTR/Unique CTR etc on Y axis.

3- Pie Charts
We can use Pie Charts to compare the CPC values between each campaign and easily find the campaign which is cost ineffiient

Feel free to plot other graphs or suggest changes to the datasets or any different approach.
